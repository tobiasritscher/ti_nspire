4.0 Release Notes

- I've added a Workspaces directory which contains formula sheets for all of the courses except differential
  equations. All of their contents are still accessible by through the search feature, as in
  AAFetch/fetch("integration by parts"). You can access material related to Differential Equations I through
  the search feature.

- Because there were getting to be too many programs under AAFetch in the menu, I broke it up into separate
  libraries to make the programs and functions easier to find. There is now
  - an AAPrecalculus library
  - an AAStatistics library
  - an AACalculus library for Calculus I and II programs
  - an AACalculus_III library for early Calculus III topics
  - a AAVectorAnalysis library for late Calculus III topics sometimes taught in a separate course
  - AALinAlg and AALinAlg_Vectors (topics from vector spaces and eigenvectors onward) are the main
    linear algebra libraries. AALinAlg_Interpo is for interpolation applications, and
    AALinAlg_MatSeq is for sequences of matrices.
  - AAFetch still contains fetch() and miscellaneous programs such as slopefield() for differential
    equations.

- Bug fixes:
  Integbyparts wasn't working because a program it relied on was missing from the previous package.

3.0 Release Notes

-Added a Lua script that allows fetch("") to bring up images. Just copy and paste the page with the image into your other document.
-Overhauled the geometry menu so that theories from geometry class can be browsed. Some of these entries, such as "alternate exterior angle", bring up an image.

-Updated nearly all the Calculus III entries for ease of reading.
-Added entries for systems of differential equations.
-Added a menu for Fourier series.
-Included Physics I and II formulas, accessible through fetch("physics"). This includes entries for units, such as conversion from Newtons to dyne.
-Calculus I: Added an entry on particular solutions to integration. Updated "Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus" to include the alternative definition of indefinite integration often used with this.

New programs and program updates:

-Updated arctrig("arctan(tan(22))") to return both answers for both radian and degrees modes.
-Linear algebra: Replaced the Vandermonde matrix program with alternant(basis,independent variable list,matrix of coordinate columns for each independent variable) Generates the alternant matrix for any basis, such as {1,X,x^2} for a quadratic function or {1,x^2,y^2} for a paraboloid on the z-axis.

--------------------
2.3 Release Notes

New programs:
Statistics programs have been split off into a second document, to make it easier to browse the library.

1) multiregression(basis,matrix) See fetch("multiple linear regression") for a fuller explanation.
2) partitions(r_list) Finds the number of possible ways to partition a set of n elements into sets of r_i elements.
3) hypergeomPdf(n,r,N,x)
4) hypergeomCdf(n,r,N,x_1,x_2)

These are intended to remove the need to create a table:
5) invDiscretePdf(P,f(x),xdomain,"left")  Find x_0 closest to P on the side of the distribution left or right of the peak.
6) invDiscreteCdf(P,f(x),xdomain,">=") Returns the x_0 such that P_table is barely = P; lower-tailed like invNorm.
7) invBinomPdf(P,n,p)
8) invBinomCdf(P,n,p,">=")
9) invPoissPdf(P,n,lambda)
10) invPoissCdf(P,n,lambda,">=") 
11) invHypergeomPdf(P,n,r,N)
12) invHypergeomCdf(P,n,r,N,">=")

New entries:
-Added all entries covering Differential Equations I. see fetch("differential equations") for the main menu.
-Added nonparametric, ANOVA-related formulas, and linear and multiple regression to the statistics section.
